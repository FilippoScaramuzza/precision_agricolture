<div style="text-align: justify">

## Introduction
The goal of the simulation is to test both a *Fog Computing* architecture for *precision agricolture* and a large-scale network simulation with the fog computing simulator, i.e [YAFS](https://github.com/acsicuib/YAFS).

## Topology and Architecture description
The reference architecture simulated is shown below:

Precision agricolture has a lot of needs, in this study case reduced to *data production* (from sensors), *data processing* (from Fog Nodes and Cloud) and *communication with actuators* (valve, tractors, etc.).

As shown in the figure above, devices are located into levels, starting from the bottom with nodes that offers none or few services to the network but generates massive amount of data, to the top level with nodes that don't produce data but provide services and computanioal power to the network. In addition, speaking about reachability, the lower the level and the more the node will be reached from limited and circumscribed areas, and also from the physical point of view will be present in the reference territory (guaranteeing low latencies).

### Architecture and level description

 * **IoT/Edge level**<br>
    This level is made of all sensors and actuators that are located into IoT area, having an extremely low computational power, power supply problems, discontinuity in data production and mobility. 
    Devices involved in this level works with low payload protocols, low consumption and hight sleep time. In this level are located Edge nodes, too. The definition of these nodes in the literature varies a lot, in general they can be defined as nodes, to the edge of the network, in which a small elaboration of the data is carried out.
 * **Fog L0 level**<br>
    Here we insert services that do not fall within the IoT level below, but that do not generally offer services to the network (i.e act mostly as a client), but only to private users. They are, for example, farm-level servers that monitor private sensors and/or actuators.
* **Fog L1 level**<br>
    Nodes that provide services and collect and aggregate data from different companies. A possible area of interest is at the provincial or sub-provincial level. These nodes offer several services to the network, for the underlying nodes and for both the overlying ones. For example, for the underlying nodes it deals with data collection, maintenance and historical consultation, communication with actuators, etc. At levels above it offers communication of data (even or only aggregates and anonymous) e.g for data processing.
* **Fog L2 level**<br>
    Nodes dealing with regional or sub-regional geographical areas. They have larger processing capabilities than the underlying level and can therefore also perform heavier tasks such as statistical analysis of aggregated data. They also offer more complex pre-processing at the level above (e.g. distributed ML algorithms).
* **Cloud level**<br>
    Here you will find several services controlled by sensor manufacturers or organizations that interface with sensors and actuators. In addition, there are also services for the management of the application that we try to simulate, which for example deal with training and running very heavy ML algorithms.

## Simulation definition and implementation

In this section device types, message formats and trasmission rate along the network will be defined, taking a look at the Python code, explaining it.

### Devices Definition

#### YAFS & Python 3

Topology (devices and links) can be defined via JSON files. Mandatory attributes are:
* **id**, i.e unique identifier  
* **IPT**, i.e *Instruction per simulation time*. They are the equivalent of IPS (*Instruction Per Second*) but the time unit is defined by the user.
* **RAM**, i.e RAM memory available
  
It's possible to also specify the power consumption with the attributes:
* **WATT**, i.e power consumption
* **POWERmin**, i.e minimum power consumption
* **POWERmax**, i.e maximum power consumption

and specify the position with:
* **coordinate**, that it is divided into:
  * **lat**, i.e latitude
  * **long**, i.e longitude

and it is also possible to specify a generic cost with:
* **COST**, i.e cost per unit time

**Example:**
```json
{
   "id": 120,   // mandatory
   "RAM": 1,    // mandatory
   "IPT": 530,  // mandatory
   "POWERmin": 574,
   "POWERmax": 646,
   "coordinate": 
    {
        "lat": 39.30,
        "long": 3.34
    }
}
```

Speaking about links between nodes, they can be defined via JSON file. Mandatory attributes are:
* **s**, i.e source, its id
* **d**, i.e destination, its id
* **BW**, i.e link bandwidth
* **PR**, i.e link propagation speed

The *latency* is dynamically computed using:
$$\frac{Message.size.bytes}{BW}+PR$$
**Example:**
```json
{
    "s": 0,
    "d": 1,
    "BW": 2,
    "PR": 10
}
```
Since it's everything written in Python, user can define the topology hardcoding node and link as follows:
```python
from yafs.topology import Topology

topology_json = {}
topology_json["entity"] = []
topology_json["link"] = []

cloud_dev    = {"id": 0, "model": "cloud","mytag":"cloud", "IPT": 5000 * 10 ^ 6, "RAM": 40000,"COST": 3,"WATT":20.0}
sensor_dev   = {"id": 1, "model": "sensor-device", "IPT": 100* 10 ^ 6, "RAM": 4000,"COST": 3,"WATT":40.0}
actuator_dev = {"id": 2, "model": "actuator-device", "IPT": 100 * 10 ^ 6, "RAM": 4000,"COST": 3, "WATT": 40.0}

link1 = {"s": 0, "d": 1, "BW": 1, "PR": 10}
link2 = {"s": 0, "d": 2, "BW": 1, "PR": 1}

topology_json["entity"].append(cloud_dev)
topology_json["entity"].append(sensor_dev)
topology_json["entity"].append(actuator_dev)
topology_json["link"].append(link1)
topology_json["link"].append(link2)

t = Topology()
t.load(topology_json)
```
```topology_json``` can be a JSON file, too.

For both nodes and links, user can define custom tags, for his specific purposes.
#### IoT/Edge level

Devices involved into this level are sensors and actuators. 

As said before those devices have a low energy consumption: for semplicity we can assume that power consumption is about from 5 mW to 100 mW. This devices also have a low RAM memory, we can assume that it is about from 64 MB to 128 MB.

Sensors and actuators can be defined as follows:
```json
{
    "id": n,
    "IPT": 1000,
    "RAM": 0.064,
    "POWERmin": 0.005,
    "POWERmax": 0.1
}
```

#### Fog L0 level

This level hosts node that act as private servers. They can be, for example, Raspberry PIs, having a 1800 IPT, 4 GB RAM and a power consumption of 3.4 W. 

L0 level devices are defined as follows:
```json
{
    "id": n,
    "IPT": 2000*10^6, // Arm raspberry cpu
    "RAM": 4,
    "WATT": 3.4
}
```

#### Fog L1 level

From this level on, nodes becomes more powerful. In this level several *city-level nodes* can be deployed, with 16 GB of RAM and  with a power consumption ranging from 250 W to 550 W:

```json
{
    "id": n,
    "IPT": 80000*10^6, // Intel i7
    "RAM": 16,
    "POWERmin": 250,
    "POWERmax": 550
}
```

#### FOG L2 level

Here can be deployed several *regional-level nodes* with 64 GB of RAM and a power consumption ranging from 750 W to 950 W.

```json
{
    "id": n,
    "IPT": 150000*10^6, // average low level server cpu
    "RAM": 64,
    "POWERmin": 750,
    "POWERmax": 950
}
```

#### Cloud level

The computational power for this level it's set to be extremely high. Values specified are fictitious:

```json
{
    "id": n,
    "IPT": 10^20,
    "RAM": 1024,
    "WATT": 10^5
}
```

### Application Definition

#### YAFS & Python 3

YAFS supports the deployment of multiples applications based on DAG (*Directed Acyclic Graph*). Apps can be defined both via Python API or using a JSON-based syntax.

Application are made of three parts:
* **Modules (Services):** Modules ddefine services of an App. A module can create messages (a pure source / sensor), a modul can consume messages (a pure sink / actuator ) and other modules can do both tasks. Mandatory attributes are the ```id``` and the ```name```. For example:
    ```json
    "module": 
    [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "name": "data_sender"
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "data_receiver",
            "type": "CLOUD"
        }
    ]
    ```
    ```type``` is a user defined attribute.
* **Messages:** Messages are the requests among services. Mandatory attributes are: 
  * ```id```
  * ```name``` 
  * ```s```: source module
  * ```d```: destination module
  * ```bytes```: message length in bytes
  * ```Ã¬nstructions```: the higher this value, the slowest gets processed.

  If the message arrive a pure sink this message does not require the last two attributes. In YAFS, it is also possible to define broadcast messages.

    **Example:** 
    ```json
    "message ": 
    [
        {
            "d": "S0", 
            "bytes": 2770205 , 
            "name": "M.USER.APP1", 
            "s": "None", 
            "id": 0, 
            "instructions": 0
        },
        {
            "d": "S0", 
            "bytes": 2770205 , 
            "name ": "M0_0", 
            "s": "S0", 
            "id": 1, 
            "instructions": 20
        },
        {
            "bytes": 22, 
            "name ": "M0-1", 
            "s": "S0", 
            "id": 2, 
            "instructions": 0,
        }
    ]
    ```

* **Transmissions:** represents how the services *process* the requests and generates other requests. ```fractional``` is the probability to propagate the input message.
    
    **Example:**
    ```json
    "transmissions": 
    [
        {
            "module": "SO",
            "message_in": "M.USER.APP1"
        },
        {
            "message_out": "M0_0",
            "message_in": "M.USER.APP1",
            "module": "SO",
            "fractional": 0.5
        }
    ]
    ```

Since it's everything written in Python, user can define the application hardcoding modules, messages and transmission as follows

```python
import random
from yafs.application import Application
from yafs.application import Message

def create_application():
    # APLICATION
    a = Application(name="SimpleCase")

    # (S) --> (ServiceA) --> (A)
    a.set_modules([{"Sensor":{"Type":Application.TYPE_SOURCE}},
                   {"ServiceA": {"RAM": 10, "Type": Application.TYPE_MODULE}},
                   {"Actuator": {"Type": Application.TYPE_SINK}}
                   ])
    
    # Messages among MODULES (AppEdge in iFogSim)
    m_a = Message("M.A", "Sensor", "ServiceA", instructions=20*10^6, bytes=1000)
    m_b = Message("M.B", "ServiceA", "Actuator", instructions=30*10^6, bytes=500)


    # Defining which messages will be dynamically generated # the generation is controlled #by Population algorithm
    a.add_source_messages(m_a)

    # MODULES/SERVICES: Definition of Generators and Consumers (AppEdges and TupleMappings #in iFogSim)
    # MODULE SERVICES
    a.add_service_module("ServiceA", m_a, m_b, fractional_selectivity, threshold=1.0)

    return a

app1 = create_aplication("Tutorial1")
```
